<h1> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp       <mark> European football: Pick your best XI from the champions of Europe's top five leagues</mark></h1>

<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe 2019-20 domestic season comes to a close in Europe this weekend as Italy's Serie A concludes.

Liverpool were crowned Premier League champions after football's restart, while Bayern Munich won the Bundesliga.

Real Madrid won La Liga, Juventus took the Serie A title, and Paris St-Germain were named Ligue 1 winners back in April after their league season was declared over.

Who makes your European league winners' XI from the aforementioned champions? Make your choices below.</p>

<p align="right"> >&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The SEC announced last week that it will play a 10-game conference-only schedule this season due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The focus immediately turned to the biggest question: Which two opponents get added to each team's schedule? That question was answered on Friday when the conference announced those new opponents for all 14 of its teams.

Each SEC team plays one permanent cross-division rival and another rotating cross-division opponent under normal circumstances. The format this year calls for two additional rotating cross-division opponents in addition to the one cross-division opponent that was already on each team's schedule. 

"We made every effort to create a schedule that is as competitive as possible and builds on the existing eight Conference games that had already been scheduled for 2020," said SEC commissioner Greg Sankey in a statement. "This schedule is a one-year anomaly that we have developed under unique circumstances presented by the impact of COVID-19."

Here's a look at the two additional opponents added to each SEC team's schedule.

The full week-by-week SEC schedule is set to be released next week and won't necessarily have schedule opponents playing on the same dates as was previously announced. It will start in the traditional <br>
Week 4 of Sept. 26 and conclude with the SEC Championship Game at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta on Dec. 19, two weeks later than originally scheduled.

Every SEC team will have a bye week on<br>
 Dec. 12 -- one week before the conference championship game. That bye week can be used to make up any games impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or as an extra week for teams to prepare.</p><br>
